# Home Disconnect

Control Home Connect Appliances through a local Websocket connection.

Used by [homeconnect_local_hass](https://github.com/vemboy200/homeconnect_local_hass), the Home Assistant integration this library was extracted for.

## Authentication and Device Description

To connect to an Appliance, you need its encryption keys and the description of its features and options. The Appliance uses either TLS PSK or AES encryption, AES requiring an additional Initialization Vector (IV). Both Key and IV are send to Home Connect cloud servers on setup. To get the keys and description from the cloud use the [Home Connect Profile Downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader) tool.

For each registered Appliance, the downloaded zip-file contains three files named with the Appliance serial number:

* `[serialNumber].json`: Contains information about the Appliance including encryption keys. The `connectionType` field indicates if the Appliance uses PSK or AES encryption. When the connection type is "AES" the Appliance uses AES Encryption and requires the IV.
* `[serialNumber]_DeviceDescription.xml` and `[serialNumber]_FeatureMapping.xml`: Contains the Device Description, see below

## Parsing Device Description

```python

import json
from pathlib import Path

from home_disconnect import parse_device_description

# Load Description from File
with Path("[serialNumber]_DeviceDescription.xml").open() as file:
    DeviceDescription = file.read()

with Path("[serialNumber]_FeatureMapping.xml").open() as file:
    FeatureMapping = file.read()

description = parse_device_description(DeviceDescription, FeatureMapping)

# Save Description to File for later use
with Path("DeviceDescription.json").open(mode='w') as file:
    json.dump(description, file)

```

Its best to save the parsed description as a json File to reuse later.

## Connecting

```python

import asyncio
import json

from home_disconnect import DeviceDescription, HomeAppliance


async def main(description: DeviceDescription) -> None:
    app_name = "Example App"  # Name of your App, can be anything
    app_id = "d50661eca7e45a"  # ID of your App, can be anything
    psk64 = "whZJhkPa3a1hkuDdI3twHdqi1qhTxjnKE8954_zyY_E="  # PSK Key
    # iv64 = "ofi7M1WB98sJeM2H1Ew3XA==" # IV for Appliances with AES Encryption

    appliance = HomeAppliance(
        description,
        "192.168.1.2",
        app_name,
        app_id,
        psk64=psk64,
        # iv64=iv64
    )
    # Connect to Appliances
    await appliance.connect()

    # Set PowerState to On
    await appliance.settings["BSH.Common.Setting.PowerState"].set_value("On")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load DeviceDescription from File
    with open("DeviceDescription.json", "r") as f:
        description = json.load(f)

    asyncio.run(main(description))

```
